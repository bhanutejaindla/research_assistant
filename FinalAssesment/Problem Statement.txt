Milestones

Milestone 1: Four Sation - "User Can Start"

Goal: Create a system where users can authenticate and initiate codebase analysis

What Users Should Be Able to Do:

1. Authentication and Signup Flow

Signup/Registration flow for new users

Login as either User or Admin

User can see their own projects

2. Project Initiation

Upload a ZIP file or provide GitHub repository URL

Select which personas to generate documentation for (SDE, PM, or both)

View project created with unique identifier

3. Basic Infrastructure

File storage and project tracking working

Configuration management for different environments

Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

API documentation available via Swagger

Invalid File Handling

System must gracefully handle and provide clear feedback for:

Corrupted or incomplete ZIP files

Files that are too large (define reasonable limit, e.g.. 100MB)

Non-code repositories (eg. pure documentation, binary only)

Wrong file formats (eg., RAR, 7z instead of ZIP)

Empty repositories or repositories with no recognizable code
Malformed GitHub URLs or private repositories without access

Demo Scenario:

User signs up logs in Uploads a repository Selects SDE and PM personas Sees "Analysis Started confirmation Project ID displayed

Milestone 2: Intelligent Preprocessing - "System Understands Structure"

Goal: Build smart prefocessing that understands what to analyze

What Users Should Be Able To Do:

1. See Repository Intelligence

System identifies repository type and structure

Important files automatically detected

File metadata extracted and stored

2. Smart File Processing

Entry points identified (main.py, index.js, etc.)

Configuration files parsed for stack understanding

Dependencies and framework detection

Skip patterns applied (node modules, git, etc.)

3. Enable Code Discovery

Code broken into logical chunks (functions, classes)

Metadata attached to each chunk (file, line numbers, type)

Semantic understanding layer built for intelligent search

Users can ask questions and system finds relevant code sections

Demo Scenario:

System processes repository Shows "Detected: Python FastAPI project"-"Found 12 API endpoints" "Identified main py as entry point" "Prepared 150 code sections for analysis" User searches "authentication" and gets relevant code sections

Milestone 3: Real-Time Progress - "User Sees Everything"
Goal Provide live visibility into analysis progress

What Users Should Be Able To Do:

1. Live Progress Updates

See current processing stage with descriptive labels

Watch file-by-file progress with names

View percentage completion

2. Structured Activity Feed

Processing updates (e.g. "Analyzing auth.py")

Milestone completions (eg.. "Preprocessing Complete")

Warning notifications (eg. "Skipped binary file: image.png")

Error alerts with clear descriptions

Demo Scenario:

Analysis starts Feed shows: "Processing file 1/100: auth.py" "Extracting functions and classes" "Building code understanding: 45% "Stage complete: Preprocessing Progress bar updates smoothly User sees real-time activity

Milestone 4: Multi-Agent Orchestra - "Agents Work Together"

Goal: Implement specialized agents with single responsibilities

What Users Should Be Able To Do:

1. Configure Agent Behavior (Hefore Analysis Starts)

Select analysis depth (Quick/Standard/Deep)

Choose documentation verbosity level

Enable/disable specific analysis features

Set preferences for diagram generation

Save configuration templates for reuse

2. Agent Orchestration via LangGraph

See different agents activating sequentially

Each agent reports its specific task

Agents pass information between each other

Parallel execution where logical

3. Web-Augmented Analysis

Agents search for latest documentation online when needed
Examples of web-augmented capabilities:

Pramework Best Practices: "Searching FastAPI documentation for async endpoint patterns"

Security Recommendations "Checking OWASP guidelines for authentication implementation"

Version-Specific Information: "Finding migration notes for React 18 features used in codebase

Library Usage Patterns 'Retrieving recommended patterns for SQLAlchemy session management"

4 Persona-Specific Agent Groups

Technical analysis agents for SDE documentation

Business logic agents for PM artifacts

Coordination agent that routes work appropriately

Demo Scenario:

User configures "Deep analysis, High verbosity Analysis starts â†’ Agent 1:

"Analyzing file structure Agent 2: "Extracting API signatures Agent 3: "Searching for Fast API best practices online Agent 4 'Generating SDE documentation Agent 5: 'Creating PM feature summary Agents work in coordinated sequence

Milestone 5: Interactive Control - "User Drives the Analysis"

Goal Enable user control with pause/resume and interactive questioning

What Users Should Be Able To Do:

1. Manual Pause & Resume

Pause analysis at any moment using Ul control

Analysis state is preserved during pause

Resume from exact point where paused

System handles pause gracefully (no data loss)

2. Interactive Intelligence-Ask Questions During Analysis

Guardrail 1-Questions About Analysis. Users can query the system about

what it's currently analyzing

Example: "What are you analyzing right now?"

Example: "Why is this taking so long?"

Example: "What have you found so far?"
Guardrail 2-Add Context to Analysis. Users can inject additional

information or instructions

Example: "Focus more on the payment module"

Example: "The authentication system uses OAuth2"

Example: This is a legacy system being migrated"

3. State Management

Analysis state saved automatically during pause

User inputs and context additions are stored

System can recover from interruptions

Previous interactions are remembered

Demo Scenario:

System Analysis running (40% complete) User clicks "Pause Analysis pauses cleanly User aske "What's the main API framework you've detected? responds: "FastAPI with 12 endpoints User adds: "The /admin routes are deprecated, focus on/api/v2 User clicks "Resume Analysis continues with added context Final documentation emphasizes v2 APls

Milestone 6: Rich Outputs - "Beautiful Documentation"

Goal: Generate comprehensive, structured documentation with visualizations

What Users Should Be Able To Do:

1. View Structured Reports

Each persona gets a tailored report with clear sections:

SDE Report: Architecture, API Docs, Database Schema, Code

Structure, Setup Guide

PM Report Feature Inventory, User Flows, Business Logic,

Integrations. Limitations

Reports use clear headings, sections, and formatting

Technical depth appropriate to persona

2. Natural Language Q&A

Ask questions about the analyzed codebase

Receive answers with code citations and file references

See relevant code snippets in context

Context-aware responses based on persona

3. Visual Diagrams with Mermaid

Architecture diagrams showing system components
Flow charts illustrating business logic

Sequence diagrams for API interactions

Entity relationship diagrams for data models

At least 4 different diagram types total

4. Export Documentation

Download complete report as Markdown

Generate PDF with rendered visualizations

Export includes all persona artifacts

Diagrams are properly formatted in exports

Minimal Approach:

Clean summary view with key findings

Sections for detailed content

Q&A interface yailable but not overwhelming

Demo Scenario:

Analysis completes User views SDE report with 6 sections Sees architecture diagram Clicks Q&A Asks "How does authentication work?" Gets detailed answer with code references Views sequence diagram Asks follow-up:

What database stores user semions Gets answer with DB schema Clicks "Export as PDF Downloads complete documentation with all diagrams rendered

Milestone 7: Observability & Admin Control - "System Transparency"

Goal: Complete observability of system operations and admin controls

What Users Should Be Able To Do:

1. Admin Dashboard-Project & User Management

View all users in the system

See all projects across users with status indicatori

Perform CRUD operations on users (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Perform CRUD operations on projects

Basic analytics (total users, active projects, completion rates)

2. System Health Monitoring

View currently running analyses
See success/failure rates

Monitor system resource usage (optional)

Access error logs

Separate Flow: Langfuse Integration for Token Tracking

Goal: Track and optimize LLM usage independently

What Should Be Tracked

Every LLM call made during analysis

Token usage per project and per agent

Cost breakdow by operation type

Performance metrics (latency, success rate)

Complete execution traces

How to Implement

Integrate Langfuse SDK in backend

Wrap all LLM calls with Langfuse tracing

Create separate observability dashboard (can be Langfuse UI)

Link traces back to projects for debugging

Demo Scenario for Langfuse:

Developer opens Langfuse dashboard Selects a project Sees complete trace

tree with 15 agent calls Views token usage: 12.500 tokens Cost: $0.40

Identifies one agent using 40% of tokens Optimizes that agent's prompt
